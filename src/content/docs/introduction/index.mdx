title: About Orbit

---

Orbit is a general-purpose CSS framework designed to create radial UI designs effortlessly. It provides intuitive CSS classes and standard web components for building radial menus, dashboards, creative portfolios, or cutting-edge applications. Whether you’re crafting a futuristic dashboard, an elegant watch face, or even sci-fi-inspired art, Orbit has you covered.

Orbit harnesses the power of space-inspired metaphors to simplify learning. By leveraging concepts like the Big Bang, orbits, satellites, gravitational centers, and gravitational force, Orbit makes it easier to grasp abstract ideas. This approach provides users with a conceptual framework to understand Orbit’s capabilities before diving into its implementation.

## Why choose Orbit?

Creating radial UIs often requires the use of JavaScript or other programming languages to calculate angles, radii, distances, and similar parameters. Orbit eliminates this complexity, saving you time and effort by enabling you to build these UIs with just CSS.

## What is a radial UI?

Radial UI refers to a design paradigm where elements are organized in a circular or radial pattern, diverging from traditional grid-based or linear layouts. 

**Characteristics of radial UI**

- **Circular Layout:** Elements are arranged in a circular or curved pattern.
- **Center-Focused:** The center often serves as a focal point, anchoring the design.
- **Symmetry:** Radial UIs frequently exhibit symmetry, fostering a sense of balance.
- **Angular Relationships:** Elements are positioned at specific angles relative to one another, creating harmony and precision.

**Benefits of radial UI**

- **Aesthetics:** Radial designs are visually striking and captivating.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Circular layouts simplify navigation, reducing cognitive load.
- **Space Efficiency:** Radial UIs make efficient use of available screen real estate, ideal for both compact and expansive interfaces.
